          regarding your upcoming development project. We specialize in HTML 5
          app and website design and development, and are excited to work with
          you to accomplish your goals. I've prepared this document as a more
          thorough introduction to [Sender.Company] as well as a detailed
          breakdown of the deliverables and pricing for your upcoming project.
        </p>

        <h2>About [Sender.Company]</h2>
        <p>
          [Sender.Company] is a development firm specializing in HTML 5 apps and
          websites. Our development team designs, builds, and supports websites
          for private and public institutions around the world. We apply a
          well-tested framework to each project that allows us to complete web
          development and application projects on time and on budget without
          sacrificing features or functionality.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="approach">
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          [Sender.Company] applies a six step framework to every development
          project. This allows us to break projects down into distinct phases so
          that we can monitor progression and results along the way.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Planning</h3>
        <p>
          Every project begins in the planning phase. In this phase, we work
          with the customer to discover what your needs, wants, and true
          objectives are. This allows us to thoroughly plan a complete project
          up front, avoiding costly delays and unforeseen challenges later on.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Design</h3>
        <p>
          In this phase, we create mockups and prototypes based on earlier
          discussions. By allowing you to review a visual representation of our
          understanding of your needs early on in the project, we can further
          solidify your requirements and discover any additional needs or
          challenges that did not present themselves in the planning phase.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Build</h3>
        <p>
          In this phase, we begin the process of building your app or website.
          We place a heavy emphasis on adhering to the technical and design
          specifications laid out in the planning phase, and perform regular
          functional tests, which allows us to correct any problems during the
          build rather than addressing them after project completion.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Test & Train</h3>
        <p>
          We perform thorough testing on all sites and apps prior to final
          launch. We simulate heavy stress to measure performance, and test
          various browsers, operating systems, and devices with the site or app
          to be sure that it is responsive and performs well across all
          platforms. We also perform training with your staff, so that they will
          be able to easily make minor adjustments or publish new content once
          your site or app is live.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Launch</h3>
        <p>
          The live launch of your site or app can be a stressful period. Even
          with thorough testing throughout development, unforeseen challenges
          can arise. That's why the [Sender.Company] team provides full
          monitoring and support during the launch period. We stand ready to
          make sure that your launch is successful, and are ready to quickly
          address any issues that arise.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Support</h3>
        <p>
          Once your site launches successfully, you'll still require a technical
          partner to support ongoing needs. We offer a wide variety of support
          services for our completed projects, including monitoring and
          optimization.
