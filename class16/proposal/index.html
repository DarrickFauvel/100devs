      <section id="approach">
        Our Approach [Sender.Company] applies a six step framework to every
        development project. This allows us to break projects down into distinct
        phases so that we can monitor progression and results along the way. 1.
        Planning Every project begins in the planning phase. In this phase, we
        work with the customer to discover what your needs, wants, and true
        objectives are. This allows us to thoroughly plan a complete project up
        front, avoiding costly delays and unforeseen challenges later on. 2.
        Design In this phase, we create mockups and prototypes based on earlier
        discussions. By allowing you to review a visual representation of our
        understanding of your needs early on in the project, we can further
        solidify your requirements and discover any additional needs or
        challenges that did not present themselves in the planning phase. 3.
        Build In this phase, we begin the process of building your app or
        website. We place a heavy emphasis on adhering to the technical and
        design specifications laid out in the planning phase, and perform
        regular functional tests, which allows us to correct any problems during
        the build rather than addressing them after project completion. 4. Test
        & Train We perform thorough testing on all sites and apps prior to final
        launch. We simulate heavy stress to measure performance, and test
        various browsers, operating systems, and devices with the site or app to
        be sure that it is responsive and performs well across all platforms. We
        also perform training with your staff, so that they will be able to
        easily make minor adjustments or publish new content once your site or
        app is live. 5. Launch The live launch of your site or app can be a
        stressful period. Even with thorough testing throughout development,
        unforeseen challenges can arise. That's why the [Sender.Company] team
        provides full monitoring and support during the launch period. We stand
        ready to make sure that your launch is successful, and are ready to
        quickly address any issues that arise. 6. Support Once your site
        launches successfully, you'll still require a technical partner to
        support ongoing needs. We offer a wide variety of support services for
        our completed projects, including monitoring and optimization.
